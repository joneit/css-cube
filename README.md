A CSS-only cube should be a required exercise for all JavaScript coders.

Hereâ€™s mine! _Demo: [GitHub CDN](https://joneit.github.io/css-cube), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/joneit/5fbLtjvj/embedded/result,js,css,html)_

The cube is constructed from six one-sided divs, and animated using CSS [`transform`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) with a [`transition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition).

I'm using JavaScript just to set the `transform` style to make my buttons work.
It all happens in [this single line](https://github.com/joneit/css-cube/blob/master/cube.js#L46).
